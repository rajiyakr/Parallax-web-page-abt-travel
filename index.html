        <h2>A Memorable Drive</h2>
        <p>The forest drive was amazing, filled with diverse trees, plants, and flowers. The kids hoped to spot wild animals but only saw cows and buffaloes, likely owned by locals. We made amusing assumptions along the way. We stopped at scenic spots, and after a winding journey, reached the mountain top with breathtaking views of the village and playful monkeys. We took lots of photos and explored more locations.</p>
